This is a Random Phrase Generator that uses a custom database of words that will be called Grammars.

A Grammar will have this format:

{
<start>
The <object> <verb> on the <object>.
}

{
<object>
cat
dog
mouse
}

{
<verb>
sat
stood
}

The code will first parse each section into a Hastable with the titles (<object>) as the key and an ArrayList holding each word or line.

The code will always start in <start> section and randomaly pick a line using a random number generator.
While reading through that line, when it comes across any word with a opening and closing angle brackets,
it will go to that section and randomly pick a word or line from it to fill in. It will repeat until there are no
angle brackets left. 
EXAMPLE: The cat stood on the mouse.
